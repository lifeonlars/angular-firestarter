## Aim to cover the following core concepts

 - Ability to add and edit entities in Firestore
 - Ability to link entities in Firestore e.g. linking an event to a venue and automatically duplicate the data in both collections
 - Ensure data is kept in sync across collections when editing
 - Structure data in Firestore to take advantage of shallow queries for entity list view vs. entity details view
 - Implement best practice Material Design components via Angular Material
 - Best practice Angular form implementation whilst allowing for easy modififaction/extension
 - 

## Usage

Create an account at https://firebase.google.com/

- Enable authentication with email, Google and Facebook via console => Authentication => Sign in method
- Enable Firestore under console => Database
- Set database permissions to enable read/write access for authenticated users

- `git clone https://github.com/lifeonlars/angular-firestarter.git firestarter`
- `cd firestarter`
- `npm install`

Create the environment files below in `src/environments/`.

#### environment.ts
```typescript
export const environment = {
    production: false,
    firebaseConfig: {
        apiKey: 'APIKEY',
        authDomain: 'DEV-APP.firebaseapp.com',
        databaseURL: 'https://DEV-APP.firebaseio.com',
        projectId: 'DEV-APP',
        storageBucket: 'DEV-APP.appspot.com',
        messagingSenderId: '123456789'
    }
};
```
#### environment.prod.ts
```typescript
export const environment = {
    production: true,
    firebaseConfig: {
        // same as above, or use a different firebase project to isolate environments
    }
};
```

And finally `ng serve`
